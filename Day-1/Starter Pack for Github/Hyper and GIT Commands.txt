# Common Command Lines Code(hyper)

Hyper is basically a command line, same as the one that we have on our system by default. 
I use windows so cmd or command prompt is the default command line for windows but hyper is way more 
efficient and cooler to use so I prefer using hyper. Moreover, it works same on windows and mac so 
that’s another advantage. Now to install and know more than this document which I am providing you must
refer to the hyper docs. You can find every piece of info there from installation to the command list.
These are just some basic code to deploy your files on GitHub or clone them on your local system.

# Gitignore

This is basically used to add the files which should be hidden and we don’t want the user to view them. 
Those files are stored inside the .gitignore file. This file is pushed along with the other files that 
need to pushed so that user can access them.

•	.filename 			-- to add the files
